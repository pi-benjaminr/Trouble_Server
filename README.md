Trouble_Server
==============
NOTE: This is actually the Trouble APP, not the server (oops)

The chat feature works perfectly.
The game works, but is very clunky to use. For one, there is no graphical display of the board, so being able to play
requires understanding the text-based gamestate that is printed to the screen. The format for that is as follows:
Number_of_Players  Current_Turn  Current_Die_Roll  [List of all piece positions- each player has four pieces]

On a players turn, they roll the die, pick which of their pieces to move, then hit the "next turn" button.
